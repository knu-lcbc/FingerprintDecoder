            <h3>Scientific Background & Purpose</h3>
            <h2></h2>
            <p> SMILES is the most dominant molecular representation used in AI-based chemical applications, but it has innate limitations associated with its internal structure.
                Here, the primary idea is to exploit the resolution and robustness provided by unique molecular representations, i.e., SMILES and SELFIES,
                reconstructed from a set of structural fingerprints. <p>  Our approach brings structural fingerprints into play as strong representational tools in chemical natural language processing
                applications by restoring the connectivity information, which is lost during fingerprint transformation, with high level of accuracy. </p>
                The construction of molecular fingerprints is indeed a lossy procedure so that the use of fingerprints leads to the generation of standalone
                interpretable tokens. Since attention is a permutation-invariant operation, fingerprints fit well into attention mechanism. Attention-based model, such as
                Transformer, can handle the unconnected features of fingerprints as shown in previous reports
                <a href="#">[1,2]</a>. For this purpose, we employed a translation-based system, namely the
                Transformer architecture, to accurately decode fingerprints back into lossless molecular representations.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hero-unit"><h3>Results</h3>
            <p>We illustrated our approach using 13 structural fingerprint examples, classified into five main categories,
                and showed that certain fingerprints can be used directly in an NLP setting as alternatives to SMILES or SELFIES.
                <p>The performance results revealed that structural fingerprints such as extended-connectivity, topological torsion,
                atom-pairs, and atomic environments can be used not only as the inputs, but also as the outputs of chemical NLP applications,
                provided that the so-called irreversible molecule-to-fingerprint conversion is feasible.</p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>To address the major limitation of structural fingerprints that preclude their implementation in NLP models, we assessed the conversion
                efficiency of fingerprints back to the molecules. We demonstrated that the reconstruction of molecules is a practical approach that achieves a
                very high accuracy for chemical applications. We believe our findings would facilitate the development of text or fingerprint-based chemoinformatic models for
                generative and translational tasks.
