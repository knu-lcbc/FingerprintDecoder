## Decoding fingerprints to lossless representations.
1.  Our aim was to exploit the idea that structural fingerprints can be used as alternatives to unique molecular representations.

2.  Restoring the connectivity information which is lost during the fingerprint conversion.

3.  Our study brings structural fingerprints into play as a very strong representational tool in chemistry related NLP applications.

4.  Our diverse selection of fingerprints provide an unbiased examination of the overall conversion performance.
